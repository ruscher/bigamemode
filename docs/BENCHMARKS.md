# Benchmarks

BiGame-mode claims a setting helps only when a measurement says so. This page
describes how measurements are made and what they found on the reference
machine. Each session in `bigame-engine/benchmarks/` keeps what its result
rests on: the report, the metrics and verdicts, the machine and its state, and
the game's own summary of every run. The per-frame captures, GPU samples and
screenshots behind them are in the history, at the tag `benchmarks-raw-data`
(`git checkout benchmarks-raw-data -- bigame-engine/benchmarks`).

## Method

- **Alternate the arms** (A B A B …), or rotate their order between rounds
  (ABC, BCA, CAB). Never group them: session drift was about 10 % in 20
  minutes, which grouped runs would attribute to the setting.
- **Discard the warm-up:** the first run of each arm, or the first pass of a
  launch.
- **At least three runs per arm**; fewer than two measured runs is
  inconclusive.
- **Spread** is the coefficient of variation of an arm. An arm above 5 % is
  inconclusive — something interfered.
- **A difference is real only if** it exceeds the larger spread of the two arms
  **and** passes Welch's t-test at 95 %. Otherwise the verdict is *no change*
  and the percentage is withheld (the raw number stays in the JSON).
- **A capped workload measures nothing.** SuperTuxKart's defaults (vsync on,
  `max_fps = 120`) hold it at the cap whatever changes; switch
  `swap-interval-vsync` off and raise `max_fps` in its configuration before
  a session.
- **Frame times, not averages alone.** Games' own per-frame logs are used where
  they exist (Crystal Dynamics `*_frametimes_*.txt`, Cyberpunk 2077
  `frames.csv`), otherwise MangoHud's. Frames of one second or more are scene
  transitions and are set aside. Settings must be identical within a session,
  except the keys under test. Runs with frame generation are not throughput
  results.
- **Compare like with like.** A game's own benchmark average covers loading
  transitions a MangoHud window excludes; in Shadow of the Tomb Raider it
  reads 3–4 fps lower for the same run.
- **The product is what is measured:** machine state is changed through
  BiGame-mode's own helper, captured before the session and restored after it,
  including on interrupt.
- glxgears and vkcube only confirm a driver works; they are never evidence.

### MangoHud capture

- Settings reach MangoHud through `MANGOHUD_CONFIGFILE`; `MANGOHUD_CONFIG`
  produced no log with 0.8.4.
- `no_display` must not be set: it suppresses the CSV too.
- OpenGL games need the `mangohud` wrapper, whose `LD_PRELOAD` attaches the
  overlay; `MANGOHUD=1` alone only enables the Vulkan layer.

## Tools

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| `cargo run -p bigame-core --example bench_native_report -- <session> [baseline] [--vary=KEY,…]` | verdicts for a session of a game's built-in benchmark, in the layout of `bigame-engine/benchmarks/` |
| `cargo run -p bigame-core --example bench_report -- <session> <baseline>` | verdicts for a SuperTuxKart A/B session |
| `cargo run -p bigame-core --example turbo_preset -- <id\|off>` and `--example launch_plan -- <executable>` | put a Turbo preset in force as Turbo does, and print the command BiGame-mode's launcher would run with it |
| *Measure the difference* (a game card's menu) | the same A/B method for any game that starts directly, driven by the application |

The sessions are driven by the scripts in `bigame-engine/scripts/`:
`bench-game.sh` (a game's built-in benchmark with its `[R]` rerun),
`bench-lab.sh` (SuperTuxKart A/B sessions), `gpu-telemetry.sh` (a GPU
sampler that forks nothing) and `scx-switch.sh` (the root side of scheduler
sessions, one Polkit approval per session). A session's raw captures stay
beside its report, ignored by git, until `clean-dev.sh --deep` moves them to
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/bigame-mode/benchmarks/raw`, where the newest 20 sessions are
kept (`RAW_KEEP`).

Each session directory holds `system.json` (the machine, with no host name,
user, home or address), the runs of every arm, and the report.

## Reference machine

AMD Ryzen 7 5700G (8C/16T, `amd-pstate-epp`, no 3D V-Cache), Radeon RX 9060 XT
(RDNA 4, 16 GB) plus the idle integrated GPU, Mesa 26.2.2, kernel 7.2.6
(7.2.7 from 2026-09-25), KDE Plasma Wayland, Proton Experimental, 3440×1440
(the 160 Hz DP-1 monitor). The machines and tool versions are in
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#hardware-notes).

A second machine, the **lab laptop**, measured AI Graphics on NVIDIA: Intel
Core i7-7700HQ, Intel HD 630 plus a GeForce GTX 1050 Ti Mobile (4 GB, NVIDIA
580.178.04) — a hybrid laptop, the game rendering on the GTX — 1920×1080,
Proton Experimental, KDE Plasma Wayland.

Results are evidence for the defaults BiGame-mode ships, not claims about other
hardware. They reach the application as fixed rules (the Booster never forces
GPU DPM) and as entries in the AI Graphics game list; nothing is measured on a
user's machine.

What follows for the code:

- `high` pins the highest *fixed* DPM state and removes the firmware's boost,
  leaving power budget unused while the GPU is equally busy. The Booster never
  forces it.
- Power profile, governor and EPP made no difference here, GPU- or CPU-bound,
  so the Booster leaves them to power-profiles-daemon and falcond.
- No scheduler was faster, so recommended profiles use `scx_sched = none`.
- AI Graphics is the first setting BiGame-mode applies that measurably moves the
  frame rate. This holds for OptiScaler 0.9.4, the tested release. The gain
  is larger where the game's XeSS runs on the slower DP4a path (the GTX).
- On the lab laptop the planner, reading that session from the local
  measurements, reports the gain but keeps the game's own XeSS as
  Recommended: the 1 % low could not be shown to be no worse.
- The session also found that OptiScaler's default configuration made the
  game exit at start on a GTX (its DLSS path on a card without DLSS); the
  configuration BiGame-mode writes turns that path off there.
- At the lab laptop's lowest preset the GPU, not the settings, is the limit:
  36–40 fps rendered whatever the resolution, and DX11 only moves the limit to
  the CPU. Nothing an upscaler does reaches 60 there, so the plan says so when
  every measurement of a game is far below 60, and names frame generation as
  the one thing that presents more frames than are rendered. lsfg-vk x2
  presented 57–58 from 27 rendered, stable; OptiScaler's frame generation
  presented 60.7 (arm E) but raised NVIDIA Xid errors on the GTX. It stays
  the user's choice.
- Turbo (falcond's per-game profile) was applied and verified — power
  profile and governor performance in the game, restored after — and made
  no measurable difference in this GPU-bound game.
- On that laptop the CPU hit its temperature limit all day: on cpu0, core
  throttling events went from 373 to 14 219 and the package spent 289 s
  slowed. The CPU temperature check in Details → Problems reports the
  kernel's throttle counters: a CPU capped by its cooling is not helped by a performance
  governor, and the check says so.
- A game that ships AMD's FidelityFX API (FSR 3.1) reaches FSR 4 through
  Proton with one launch option and no files, at the same frame rate as its
  FSR 3.1, while OptiScaler on top of the same game measured 6 % slower. The
  planner therefore keeps the game's own FSR as Recommended there, and
  OptiScaler only where the game has no FSR path (Shadow of the Tomb Raider)
  or the game list records it as faster.
- The game's `XESS` registry value 1 is *Performance* in its menu and 3 is
  *Quality*; the results above record the upscaler, not its preset.

### Turbo presets (2.1.0)

Single runs per configuration, the game's own benchmark, GPU power read from
the RX 9060 XT's sensor every 0.5 s. They show what each lever does, not a
throughput verdict: no arm was repeated.

| Game | Standard | Preset | What it shows |
|---|---|---|---|
| SuperTuxKart 1.5, native, started by BiGame-mode's launcher (Gamescope, 3440×1440, vsync off) | 455 FPS typical, 142 steady; GPU 53 W, 62 % busy | Locked 60: 60 typical, 59 steady; GPU 31 W, 15 % busy | MangoHud's `fps_limit` holds a native game; Gamescope's `-r` and `--framerate-limit` did not (570 FPS presented) |
| Cyberpunk 2077, RT Ultra, FSR 2.1 auto | 37.5 FPS | Enhanced: 37.3 FPS | vkBasalt's CAS costs about nothing here; Proton's FSR 4 provider loaded, used only once FSR 3.1/4 is chosen in the game; the 60 cap is not reached |
| Shadow of the Tomb Raider, OptiScaler frame generation | 62.5 FPS (game counter) | Locked 60: 30.0 FPS | a cap counts the frames shown, generated ones included: the game renders half. The preset now names such games |
| Shadow of the Tomb Raider in Gamescope from Steam's launch options (3440×1440 output) | 70.3 FPS | Enhanced: 30.0 FPS, GPU 44 W against 99 W | Gamescope wraps a Steam game through its launch options; the same frame-generation halving under the cap |

## Limits

- Rendered frames only. Latency was never measured.
- FSR 4 cannot be proven from OptiScaler's log (only its overlay shows which
  model runs); FSR 3.1 can, and on NVIDIA it was. For the game's own FSR
  through Proton the evidence is the provider mapped in the running game and
  Wine's `amdxc` channel (off by default), not an image.
- A visual-quality comparison was inconclusive: captures at fixed times land on
  different frames.
- Two machines and a handful of titles. Hybrid and multi-CCD CPUs, 3D
  V-Cache, RTX and Intel GPUs, and Gamescope native versus nested have not
  been measured; NVIDIA only as the GTX above, rendering for an Intel GPU that drives the panel.
- At the lab laptop's ~16 fps the frame-time floor varies too much between
  runs to compare; averages are what those runs establish.
- Presented frames on the reference desktop: with the system's lsfg-vk and
  MangoHud packages, MangoHud sits above lsfg-vk in the layer order and
  counts only the game's own frames (0.99× with x2 on); forcing the order
  with `VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS` hung Shadow of the Tomb Raider at start. On the
  lab laptop, with a per-user lsfg-vk manifest, the order was the other way
  round and MangoHud counted generated frames.
- lsfg-vk does not start or stop generating for a game already running, so
  an lsfg-vk arm needs its own launch; only the multiplier can alternate
  within one.
- Keep other load off the machine while benchmarking; a virtual machine on the
  same host caused multi-second stalls in one session.
